Project #2 - Tic Tac Toe
    1. My application has a restart button
    2. My application has a display.
    3. My application has a clickable tic tac toe field
      a. Follow the rules of tic tac toe (i.e. alternatin players, first cross wins, tie games)
    4. My display will return the winner of the game (X or O) if there is a winner. Alternatively, if it's a tie, the display should return a "Tie Game"
